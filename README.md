# vivaldi-customisation
UI customisation mods for Vivaldi, the web browser. Get Vivaldi [_here_](https://vivaldi.com/)

This modification alters the highly customisable UI offered by Vivaldi, to be more "aesthetic" as per my liking

I will most likely upload individual files that modify individual components of Vivaldi's UI instead of a single large file with all customisations


**Default UI:** ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67533410/116580225-cabf6f80-a930-11eb-95eb-c3ec25c74c5f.png)

**Customised UI:** ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67533410/116579142-ba5ac500-a92f-11eb-89aa-d8e73bd253b2.png)

This mod is still not completed, and it might not work properly for everyone who tries it.


##### Made for Vivaldi ver. 3.7.2218.58, although it _should_ work with other versions
