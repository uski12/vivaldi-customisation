# vivaldi-customisation
UI customisation mods for Vivaldi, the web browser. Get Vivaldi [here](https://vivaldi.com/)

This modification alters the highly customisable UI offered by Vivaldi, to be more "aesthetic" as per my liking

I will most likely upload individual files that modify individual components of Vivaldi's UI instead of a single large file with all customisations
